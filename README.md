# Noise Whisperers: Dog Barking Policy Database

Welcome to **Noise Whisperers**, a global project to collect and verify dog barking policy facts, case law, and ordinances for Wikipedia’s [WikiProject Dog Barking Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Proposals). We aim to create a neutral, verifiable database of noise-related laws across countries like USA, Germany, and beyond.

## Mission
- Build a comprehensive, sourced list of dog barking cases and policies.
- Support Wikipedia articles with reliable data.
- Foster global collaboration among legal experts, activists, and community members.

## Structure
- `cases/[country]/`: Case law and ordinances (e.g., `cases/usa/`, `cases/germany/`).
- `drafts/`: WikiProject drafts and templates.
- `policies/`: Statutory laws and regulations (e.g., BGB § 906, municipal codes).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: How to add cases or sources.
- `Issues`: Suggest cases, sources, or countries.
- `Discussions`: Brainstorm policies or interpretations.

## Get Involved
- Add a case to `cases/[country]/` via [Issues](https://github.com/noisewhisperers/barking_cases/issues).
- Suggest sources (e.g., court rulings, journals) or new countries.
- Join discussions on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/noisewhisperers/barking_cases/discussions).
- Contact us on X (@NoiseWhisperers, #NoiseWhisperers).
