# Noise Whisperers: Dog Barking Policy and Legal Theories Database

Welcome to **Noise Whisperers**, a global open-source project to collect dog barking case law, policies, and legal theories for Wikipediaâ€™s [WikiProject Dog Barking Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Proposals). We focus on **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data, including theories on the **right to quiet** and **right to a loud barking dog**.

## Mission
- Build a sourced database of barking cases, policies, and legal theories.
- Support Wikipedia with neutral, verifiable content.
- Engage global contributors (legal experts, activists, pet owners).

## Structure
- `cases/[country]/`: Case law (e.g., `cases/usa/`, `cases/germany/`).
- `policies/[country]/`: Statutes and ordinances.
- `theories/`: Legal theories (e.g., right to quiet, pet ownership rights).
- `drafts/`: WikiProject drafts.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Contribution guidelines.
- `Issues`/[Discussions](https://github.com/noisewhisperers/barking_cases/discussions): Suggest cases, policies, or theories.

## Get Involved
- Add cases to `cases/[country]/` or theories to `theories/` via [Issues](https://github.com/noisewhisperers/barking_cases/issues).
- Suggest sources (e.g., [juris.de](https://www.juris.de), [FindLaw](https://www.findlaw.com)).
- Join discussions on legal theories (e.g., nuisance vs. property rights).
- Contact us on X (@NoiseWhisperers, #NoiseWhisperers).
