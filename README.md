# Noise Whisperers: A Project to Understand Dog Barking Laws

Welcome to **Noise Whisperers**, a global effort to gather clear, reliable information about dog barking laws, court cases, and legal ideas. We know that excessive barking can disrupt lives—keeping people awake, stressing families, or making quiet homes feel chaotic. But we also recognize that dogs are beloved pets, and their owners have rights too. Our goal is to create a fair, open database that helps everyone understand the rules around barking, from those seeking peace to those caring for their dogs.

We’re building this for Wikipedia’s future [WikiProject Dog Barking Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Proposals), using free, trustworthy sources like court rulings and laws. Whether you’re affected by noise, a dog owner, or just curious, you can help us grow this project!

## Why This Matters
Noise pollution, like constant dog barking, can harm health and well-being, as studies by the World Health Organization show. At the same time, pet ownership is a valued part of life, protected by laws in many countries. Our project collects facts about barking laws and cases—such as Germany’s 1995 Cologne case, which limited barking to 30 minutes a day, or Los Angeles’ rule against barking for over 10 minutes—to help people understand their rights and responsibilities. We explore legal ideas like the **right to quiet** (protection from noise) and the **right to a barking dog** (pet ownership freedoms), always staying neutral and factual.

## What’s in This Project
We organize information in a way that’s easy to find, open to everyone, and ready for Wikipedia or research (following **FAIR** principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Here’s what you’ll find:

- **Cases**: Court cases and local rules by country (e.g., `cases/usa/`, `cases/germany/`).
- **Policies**: Laws about noise or pets (e.g., Germany’s BGB § 906 on disturbances).
- **Theories**: Legal ideas, like the right to quiet or the right to a barking dog, explained neutrally (`theories/`).
- **Drafts**: Plans for Wikipedia’s WikiProject (`drafts/`).
- **Contributing**: How you can help (`CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- **Issues & Discussions**: Places to suggest ideas or talk about barking laws.

## How You Can Help
Anyone can join—whether you’re a neighbor tired of barking, a dog owner, a lawyer, or a student. No technical skills needed! Here’s how to get involved:

- **Share a Case or Law**: Know a barking case or noise rule in your country? Suggest it in our [Issues](https://github.com/noisewhisperers/barking_cases/issues).
- **Add a Source**: Found a court ruling or news article? Share the link.

## Our Commitment
We follow Wikipedia’s rules for neutrality and reliable sources, ensuring our data is fair and trustworthy. We respect all perspectives—those seeking quiet and those defending their dogs—and aim to build a community that’s open and collaborative. All our work is public, free, and meant to help people understand barking laws better.
